<p>For my final I was thinking of doing something like a portfolio.</p>
<p>I'm a desinger and illustrator, but since I'm in a Graphic Design degree not a lot of people know I also do art.</p>
<p>I've been doing Graphic Design for probably about four years now, and have been doing digital art for almost five!</p>

            <h2>Ideas for final!</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Portfolio page</li>
                    <li>Info page about me and my Experenince</li>
                    <li>A resume</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <aside>
         <p>Heres the pro's and con's of each options</p>
<ol>
    <li>Pros of Portfolio - It could be something I can use in the future! But it could be a lot more work then I need to give myself for the final</li>
    <li>A fun and interesting way of getting to know me! But could sound too much like a resume</li>
    <li>A great way to keep my resume in one place. But not a lot of jobs want a website form resume</li>
</ol>

<!--I cant figure out why the ordered list is stacking like it is? on the website it looks like its all just one big sentence, but it should be??-->

<!--I had a hard time this one, i couldn't figure out how to like spereate two different paragraph css codes, so that's why its all the same color and aligment, I'd appreciate the feedback or guidance.-->
